//    You might ask whether itâ€™s better to declare a property with a custom getter, or define a function inside the class (referred to as a member function or method in Kotlin). Both options are similar: There is no difference in implementation or performance; they only differ in readability. Generally, if you describe the characteristic (the property) of a class, you should declare it as a property. If you are describing the behavior of a class, choose a member function instead.
